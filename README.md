# Getting started
Figma link (registration is needed to see design details - spacing, colors etc): https://www.figma.com/file/yxjleoTJVTTbJCDEhNl8ko/KN-Test

## Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

```
npm run dev
```

This command will start the Vite development server and you should be able to access your application in the browser at the address provided in the terminal.

### Additional information
Since the task stated that the usage of third-party design libs/components is prohibited I decided to not use any CSS framework
